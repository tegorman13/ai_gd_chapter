	- Core issue of the Marjieh 2024 paper (multi-armed bandit problem)
- Issue of differences between human and AI team members
	- Bienefeld 2023 found differences between interactions with human vs. AI team members


### group decision making issues

- How well groups can identify expertise within their group (Bonner & Baumann
- ill defined decision tasks, where the criteria, or attributes might not be known - require meta-communication within the group to establish how a decision will be made
- shared vs. unshared information - hidden profile problem 
- (inference vs. preference)  x (choice vs. judgement)
- Cases where individual members make estimates/evaluations independently, and then a decision is made via some combination rule. OR cases in which communication is used to integrate information - which is then used to form a single estimatation/evaluation.
