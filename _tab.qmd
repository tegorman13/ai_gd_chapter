(2023); Yang et al. (2024) |
| **Online Experiments** | Varied tasks (e.g., text analysis, opinion formation, consensus building, games, surveys, simulated work tasks) | Group agreement, information sharing, bias measures, survey responses, behavioral logs, communication content analysis | Tessler et al. (2024); Chuang et al. (2024); Sidji et al. (2024); Nishida et al. (2024) |
