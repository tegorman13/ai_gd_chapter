Help me write a detailed prompt that I can re-use when querying llm's to to provide summary reports of academic papers. 

Information I want: 

Type of paper: (empirical research paper, simulation study, theoretical review, meta analysis). 
Human data collection: (yes or no)
Individual Decision Making: (yes or no)
Group Decision Making: (yes or no)
Large language model: (yes or no)

Human and AI Interaction (HAI):(yes or no)

If yes to HAI: 
- what type(s) of AI (e.g., llm, classification model, vision model)
- Is some aspect of the AI manipulated - if so how, and within-groups or between-groups?
- What role does the AI play (e.g., advisor, devils advocate, mediator, Aggregation, other)

Description of experimental task and procedure (if applicable)
  
Which of these issues does the paper touch on (if none - say nothing)

1. **Information Acquisition**: AI can play a role in generating or supplying information that participants must evaluate.
2. **Encoding and Representation:** How information is received, interpreted, and mentally organized by individuals.

3. **Information Retrieval and Integration:** How individuals recall relevant information and combine it to form a collective understanding. OR Shared Mental model. OR Transactive Memory. 

4. **Judgment and Choice:** How the group evaluates options and makes a final decision.
5. Trust, Risk, Over-reliance, Cognitive Load, complementarity, explainable AI
6. Decision Making Biases
