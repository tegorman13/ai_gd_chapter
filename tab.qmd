### Table 1: Research Methods in Human-AI Group Decision-Making

| Research Method | Task Types | Key Measures | Example Studies | Strengths | Limitations |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Laboratory Experiments** | Simplified, controlled tasks (e.g., classification, judgment, resource allocation, logic puzzles) | Decision accuracy, response time, trust ratings, reliance on AI, eye-tracking, think-aloud protocols, physiological measures | Chiang et al. (2024); Bu√ßinca et al. (2021); Swaroop et al. (2024) | High control, causal inference, precise measurement of behavior | Limited ecological validity, often simplified tasks, potential for demand characteristics, limited generalizability |
| **Field Studies** | Complex, real-world tasks (e.g., medical diagnosis, emergency response, project planning, incident response) | Team performance, communication patterns, system adoption, qualitative observations (interviews, focus groups), workflow analysis | Bienefeld et al. (2023); Yang et al. (2024) | High ecological validity, real-world outcomes | Less experimental control, smaller sample sizes, difficult to isolate specific AI effects, potential for confounding variables |
| **Online Experiments** | Varied tasks (e.g., text analysis, opinion formation, consensus building, games, surveys, simulated work tasks) | Group agreement, information sharing, bias measures, survey responses, behavioral logs, communication content analysis | Tessler et al. (2024); Chuang et al. (2024); Sidji et al. (2024); Nishida et al. (2024) | Large samples, cost-effective, access to diverse populations, can study large-scale dynamics | Less control over participation, limited interaction depth, potential for self-selection bias, difficulty ensuring data quality |
| **Observational Studies** | Real-world collaborative activities (e.g., collaborative writing, decision support usage, team coordination, online discussions) | Usage patterns, adaptation over time, natural behaviors, communication analysis, qualitative observations | Radivojevic et al. (2024); Ma et al. (2024) | Natural behavior, temporal dynamics, rich qualitative data, can study evolving interactions | No experimental manipulation, selection effects, difficulty in establishing causality, observer bias |
