Find papers that I definitely want to read and talk about


Create tables that showcase different types of 'AI' that are used in decision making research
- LLM
- Classifiers
- decision trees
- CNNs (steyvers)

Table with column for type of decision making task, and column for how AI plays a role




Then, just choose I sensible category to write a section on
- interactive tasks
- similarity to human
- decision aid vs. teams vs. combination
