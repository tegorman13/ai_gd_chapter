Find papers that I definitely want to read and talk about


Create tables that showcase different types of 'AI' that are used in decision making research
- LLM
- Classifiers
- decision trees
- CNNs (steyvers)

Table with column for type of decision making task, and column for how AI plays a role

Test


Then, just choose I sensible category to write a section on
- interactive tasks
- similarity to human
- decision aid vs. teams vs. combination

**Improvements:**

- **Specificity:** While you mention various domains where AI is used in group decision-making, providing a concrete example or two could make the introduction more engaging. For instance, you could briefly mention how AI is used in medical diagnosis teams or in financial risk assessment.
- **Define "AI":** While the term "AI" is widely understood, briefly defining what you mean by it in this context (e.g., machine learning algorithms, LLMs, etc.) could enhance clarity.
- **Expand on Challenges:** You list several challenges associated with human-AI collaboration. Briefly elaborating on one or two of these challenges could strengthen your argument. For example, you could mention how over-reliance on AI might lead to a decline in critical thinking skills among group members.


Improvement suggestions and additional paper citations:

1. **Clarify the scope of AI in group decision-making**: The introduction could benefit from a clearer definition of the types of AI systems and group decision-making contexts being considered. For example, are you focusing on machine learning, natural language processing, or expert systems? Are the groups being considered small teams or large organizations?
    
2. **Provide more nuanced discussion of challenges**: While the introduction mentions several challenges associated with AI-assisted group decision-making, it would be helpful to provide more detail and nuance. For example, what specific types of cognitive biases are most relevant in this context? How do issues of trust and over-reliance manifest in different types of groups?
    
3. **Emphasize the importance of context**: The introduction notes that the impact of AI on group performance is context-dependent, but this point could be emphasized more strongly. Consider highlighting specific contextual factors that influence the effectiveness of AI-assisted group decision-making, such as group size, task complexity, or cultural background.
